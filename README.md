# Clif's Catalog 🍎🍔
### A web app for finding an optimal meal suggestion for you based off of personal preferences, previous favorites, or a randomly generated suggestion.

#### Thank you for checking out my repository for my latest project. I have recently started throwing together this web app as an extension to a previous project. I plan to have full spectrum usage with this web app, from the front-end to the back-end: including account creation + database storing meal favorites. 

#### The idea originally started as a project to create a random meal suggestion. As seen in my meal repository, my wife and I are very indecesive. I created this random meal suggestion app in efforts to combat our indecesiveness; this way, whenever we don't know what to eat, we can just grab a suggestion from this app. However, after browsing for a new project to dive into, I decided to expand on my previous work with this. 

#### It has been very interesting diving into the usage of API's (TheMealDB API was used for this project). Learning how to iterate through the data obtained from API Fetch proved to be difficult, but I always love a good challenge. Another big challenge endured throughout this project was deciding how to handle user authentication; I ended up going with Auth0 for my authentication purposes.

#### In the future, I will be adding more things like stated before, such as meals recommended based off preferred meal styles and meal favorites history. I am looking forward to the end result.
