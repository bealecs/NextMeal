### View the build preview of the main branch [here](https://clifs-catalog-v2.vercel.app/) and follow along as we build

**[Jason Vallery](https://github.com/JVSONV) and [Clif Beale](https://github.com/bealecs) are tag teaming this project**

__The name of the project is to be changed, seeing as Jason and Clif are co owning this project__

#### Technologies that are being leveraged:
- React/Next.js/TypeScript
- Next-Auth for authentication
- Prisma for backend (User database)
- Spoonacular (API endpoints)

The inspiration comes from one of Clif's initial projects as a web developer: Clif's Catalog. However, the new app will be being extended to something greater. We are leveraging a new site for our API endpoints that has a greater store of information/meals/recipes. With the new app, our users are able to sign up by creating an account, set preferences to enhance the search for recipes/meals, and even favorite meals to their account for later! All of this comes with similar functionality to the previous app, with some new upgrades as well.

#### Introducing: My Sous-chef
**My Sous-chef** can really do a lot, however its core functionality in the app is to help indecesive users. Extra functionality also includes, but is not limited to, helping users discover new recipes/meals, finding names of meals/recipes that are lost to the user, and more. This feature leverages Vercel's new AI SDK to incorporate OpenAI's Chat-GPT into our app.

#### Follow Along: 

We are currently still in the developmental stage of the creation process. Star the repo, and follow along as we make daily improvements to better the app for our users.
